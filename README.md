# Capirai

## Why does this exist?

I created this project because I am learning Italian and wanted a place to store all of my learned words so I could track how close I was to the milestones of word quantities based on the Pareto Principle "100, 500, 1000, etc." It quickly transitioned into doubling as a study tool where I could study the words and store them based on my understanding level and then reinforce them with AI generated stories based on my CEFR level and genre of interest.
